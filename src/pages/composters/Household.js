        ECOBIA's home composting machine is an electric composting unit ideal
        for small-scale waste generators like homes, coffee shops, schools, and
        offices. The household composting machine utilizes microbes to compost
        food waste in 24 hours, producing a nutrient-rich soil amendment that
        can be used in gardens.
